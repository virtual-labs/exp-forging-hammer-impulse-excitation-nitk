Given Data:
F<sub>0</sub> - Impulse load acting on anvil (N)<br>
m<sub>1</sub> - Mass of the base (kg) <br>
k<sub>1</sub> - Stiffness of the base (N/m) <br>
m<sub>2</sub> - Mass of the anvil (kg) <br>
k<sub>2</sub> - Stiffness of the anvil (N/m) <br>

The response of the forge i.e m<sub>1</sub> and m<sub>2</sub> for different magnitudes of impulse forces F<sub>0</sub> can be observed.

1. On clicking the simulation tab, the first page is displayed as shown below.

Here, the user can set F<sub>0</sub> which will be the magnitude with which the hammer (animated red rectangle) will fall on the m<sub>2</sub> and m<sub>1</sub>. The response of the system can be adjusted by varying k<sub>3</sub>, k<sub>1</sub>, m<sub>1</sub>, k<sub>2</sub> and m<sub>2</sub>.

<br>
2. On clicking the next button, the mode shapes will be displayed, while the simulation is running.
