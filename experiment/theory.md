Impulse force can be defined as a force of large magnitude that acts for a short time. It can be measured by finding the change it causes in the momentum of system.

The initial conditions are given by

Forging is a technology that is built using trial and error method over a period of time, it was an experience oriented technology. The hammer when used over a billet impresses an impulse force. The billet and mass absorb the mass and undergo displacement. For this experiment, the displacement of the masses are simulated when an impulse force is acted upon it.

The displacement for the masses are calculated as, X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>, which are also the static amplitudes

The x<sub>1</sub> and x<sub>2</sub> are the dynamic amplitudes which is the cos function of time
